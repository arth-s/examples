# ArthSwap SDK Examples

Welcome to the ArthSwap SDK Examples repository! This repository is a collection of practical examples demonstrating the integration with the ArthSwap SDK. 

Our examples are largely inspired by, and most are compatible with, the [Uniswap V3 SDK](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/v3/overview). We have taken the best practices from the Uniswap V3 SDK and adapted them to fit the needs of the ArthSwap ecosystem.

## What is ArthSwap SDK?

ArthSwap SDK is a powerful, flexible software development kit that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the ArthSwap protocol. It provides a set of tools and libraries designed to make it easier for developers to create, test, and deploy smart contracts, interact with the ArthSwap protocol, and more.

## What can you find in this repository?

In this repository, you will find a variety of examples that showcase the capabilities of the ArthSwap SDK. These examples cover a wide range of use cases, from simple token swaps to more complex liquidity management strategies.

We hope these examples will serve as a valuable resource for developers looking to integrate with the ArthSwap SDK. Happy coding!
